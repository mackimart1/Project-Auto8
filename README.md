**README.md:**
This is a self-improving script that utilizes machine learning algorithms to iteratively enhance its performance, accuracy, and efficiency in completing designated tasks. The script consists of the following components:

* Data Collector: Collects data from various sources, including script execution logs, user interactions, environment sensors, and external APIs.
* Data Preprocessor: Preprocesses the collected data by handling missing values, normalizing data, and selecting features.
* Model Trainer: Trains a Reinforcement Learning model using the preprocessed data.
* Model Deployer: Deploys the trained model for script execution.
* Script Executor: Executes the script using the trained model.

To use this script, follow these steps:

1. Collect data using the Data Collector component.
2. Preprocess the collected data using the Data Preprocessor component.
3. Train a Reinforcement Learning model using the Model Trainer component.
4. Deploy the trained model using the Model Deployer component.
5. Execute the script using the Script Executor component.
